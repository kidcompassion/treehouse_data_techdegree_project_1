    #   When the program starts, we want to:
    #   ------------------------------------
    #   1. Display an intro/welcome message to the player.
    #   2. Store a random number as the answer/solution.
    #   3. Continuously prompt the player for a guess.
    #     a. If the guess is greater than the solution, display to the player "It's lower".
    #     b. If the guess is less than the solution, display to the player "It's higher".

    #   4. Once the guess is correct, stop looping, inform the user they "Got it" and store the number of guesses it took in a list.
    #   5. Display the following data to the player
    #     a. How many attempts it took them to get the correct number in this game
    #     b. The mean of the saved attempts list
    #     c. The median of the saved attempts list
    #     d. The mode of the saved attempts list
    #   6. Prompt the player to play again
    #     a. If they decide to play again, start the game loop over.
    #     b. If they decide to quit, show them a goodbye message.

    # ( You can add more features/enhancements if you'd like to. )
